My (Praneeth Chunduru) collection of postcards.

Note of Thanks:
I am grateful for every card you sent me but I may miss acknowledging to you that I received it.
I want to carry all of your wishes withh me all the time, so I developed this site. You can look at the cards you sent me by searching forthe following details: name, location, type of cancellation and date.
I will try to upload the images and your page as soon as I receive the card.
This page will serve as a temporary site, until I can buy/build a secure website or a blog.

Thanks and regards,
Praneeth.
